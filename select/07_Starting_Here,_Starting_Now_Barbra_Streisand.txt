That was my son's favorite song
From Sesame Street
This is one of mine

Starting here, starting now
When we walk, we'll walk together
Year by year
Starting here, starting now
When we talk
We will say the most with silence
When we're near

Starting here
Now when you sleep
You will dream a dream
That's free from care

For now, when you wake
I'll be there
So be still, take my hand
For the greatest journey
Heaven can allow

Starting love
Starting here
Starting now

Now take my hand
For the greatest journey
Heaven can allow

Starting love
Starting here
Starting now, again
